  commands:
    # 1. Code formatting check
    fmt:
      run: |
        echo "Running 'go fmt' check..."
        # 'go fmt' doesn't provide a non-zero exit if it changes files, so you can do a diff check:
        go fmt ./...
        # Optionally, you could do something like:
        # git diff --exit-code
        # to fail if there are uncommitted changes after running go fmt.

    # 2. Lint
    lint:
      run: |
        echo "Running 'golangci-lint'..."
        golangci-lint run

    # 3. Tests
    test:
      run: |
        echo "Running 'go test'..."
        go test -v ./...
